# ðŸ¤–xDAI Discord Bot
Let's build a xDAI bot for Discord. Easily send tips to your friends on Discord.
Add this bot to your server: https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=513319931018870795&scope=bot&permissions=0

## How to set up the bot

//Defines that JavaScript code should be executed in "strict mode"
'use strict'
//Config file that holds all the important information
//put inside .gitignore
module.exports={
botToken: "Your_bot_token",
}'

> Inside "xDAI-Discord-bot" folder in command (CLI) > Run >> npm install (this should install all the dependencies)

## Five Simple commands in Discord
It is easy to control the bot.  Simply use these five main commands:

`/Help `

`/tip @userName <xDAI_Amount>/penny/nickel/dime/quarter/dollar`
Send xDAI to another Studio member.

`/bal`

`/withdraw` [ Coming Soon ]

## Extra credit
`/donate <xDAI_Amount>`
You can even use this donate command to give a bit of xDAI to the Studio Bot and show some support.
