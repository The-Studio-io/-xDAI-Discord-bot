# ü§ñxDAI Discord bot
Let's build a xDAI bot for Discord. Easily send tips to your friends on Discord.


## Five Simple commands in Discord
It is easy to control the bot.  Simply use these five main commands:

`!Help `
Will show all of the bot commands

`!tip @userName <xDAI_Amount>/penny/nickel/dime/quarter/dollar`
Send xDAI to another Studio member.

`!bal`
Check your balance. You will receive a DM with your balance.

`!deposit`
Check your Deposit Address. You will receive a DM with an address you can send xDAI to.

`!withdraw` [ Coming Soon ]
You can withdraw to external account. Withdrawal fee is a penny.


## Extra credit
`!donate <xDAI_Amount>`
You can even use this donate command to give a bit of xDAI to the Studio Bot and show some support.
